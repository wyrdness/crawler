      "full": "The Crawler is a modern cryptid described as an extremely pale, emaciated humanoid creature that moves primarily on all fours with unsettling speed and flexibility. Witnesses report it as having elongated limbs, sunken features, and the ability to move in ways that seem to defy normal human anatomy. Unlike traditional cryptids with deep historical folklore roots, the Crawler phenomenon emerged primarily through internet forums and YouTube reports in the 2000s-2010s. Despite its modern origins, witnesses maintain these are genuine encounters with an unknown creature rather than internet-inspired fiction. Sightings are most commonly associated with cave systems, abandoned mines, and remote wilderness areas. The creature is described as having pale, hairless skin, a skeletal build, and large dark or reflective eyes. It typically flees when exposed to bright light and appears to be nocturnal. The Crawler represents a fascinating intersection of modern cryptozoology and internet-age folklore, with approximately 150 documented reports primarily from North America, particularly concentrated in the Appalachian region and areas with extensive cave systems."
