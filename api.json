      "full": "The Crawler is a modern cryptid described as an extremely pale, thin humanoid creature that moves primarily on all fours with unsettling speed and flexibility. Witnesses report it as having elongated limbs, sunken features, and the ability to move in ways that seem to defy normal human anatomy. Unlike traditional cryptids with historical folklore roots, the Crawler phenomenon emerged primarily through internet forums and YouTube reports in the 2000s-2010s. Sightings are often associated with cave systems, abandoned mines, and remote wilderness areas. While sharing similarities with other pale humanoid entities from internet folklore, witnesses maintain these are genuine encounters with an unknown creature."
